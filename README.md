# DATABASE DESIGN PROJECT SPRING 2024

# MySQL + Flask Boilerplate Project

This repo contains a boilerplate setup for spinning up 3 Docker containers: 
1. A MySQL 8 container 
1. A Python Flask container to implement a REST API
1. A Local AppSmith Server

## Project Summary:
1. FitTrack is a comprehensive fitness management system designed to streamline operations for fitness centers by centralizing membership management, attendance tracking, class scheduling, and member profiles. By consolidating these functions into one user-friendly platform, FitTrack simplifies administrative tasks, enhances member experience, and enables efficient decision-making for gym owners and managers. With automated processes and insightful analytics, FitTrack aims to optimize resource allocation, increase member engagement, and ultimately contribute to the success and growth of fitness businesses.
2. Using **AppSmith** as our front end to display our mock data that we got from **Mockaroo**
3. Implemented **RestAPI** routing using **Python Flask** | Tested using **Thunder Client**
4. Created a database model and implementation from scratch using LucidCharts to map out our ER diagrams and database and converted it into a **MySQL** database
5. We stored all our data and information in **Docker** containers in order to have a seamless flow between all ends.
